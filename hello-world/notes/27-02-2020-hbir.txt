RoadMap:

1) Implement vvadd
	Required Features:
	- One dimensional group construction
	- One dimensional data partitioning
	- Data Streaming from dram to scratchpad of same-size vectors
	- Tensor addition

	Limitations:
	- code blocks:
		- inputs must be the same size
	- streaming:
		- scratchpad is always divided evenly among inputs
		- streaming cannot be nested (nor does it make sense)
		- only support vvadd store from scratchpad to dram
